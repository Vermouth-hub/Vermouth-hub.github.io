### Luogu Learning Journey

#### Introduction

I am a high school student who loves programming and algorithm. I have been using Luogu to learn programming and algorithm for a long time. Luogu is a great platform for learning programming and algorithm, and I have made a lot of progress in my learning journey. In this post, I will share some of my experiences and lessons learned from Luogu.

#### Some basic knowledge (Part 1)
In this part, I will introduce some basic knowledge about programming and algorithm. And this part will record some of the basic knowledge that I have learned from Luogu.
Following shows how to express the max number in the type of int.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<climits>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << INT_MAX << endl;        // 输出int的最大值
    return 0;
}
```
